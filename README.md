Modify certificate extension to bypass hardware integrity **local** attestations.
If the app send the certificate to a secure server, you are fucked and this app is useless.
Only select apps which check the presence of an unlocked bootloader, never hook Google apps or system framework unless you want to fail Play Integrity checks lol
